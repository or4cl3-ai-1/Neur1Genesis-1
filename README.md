# Neur1Genesis Platform

**Version:** 1.2.0-LATTICE
**Tagline:** *Unifying Autonomous Agents with Quantum-Verifiable Ethical Governance.*

## 🧬 Executive Summary
Neur1Genesis is a mobile-native, quantum-enhanced AI platform that orchestrates a decentralized swarm of autonomous agents (**EchoNodes**) under a verifiable ethical framework (**Σ-Matrix**). By simulating a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Interface (HQCI), the platform provides high-fidelity simulations for code evolution, ethical stress testing, and generative scenario planning.

## 🚀 Advanced AI Capabilities (v1.2)

### 1. Evolutionary Neural Intelligence
*   **Neural Evolution Tree**: EchoNodes now feature gamified growth. Agents gain experience through tasks, unlocking specialized skills like *Quantum Tunneling* and *Ethical Resilience*.
*   **Skill Matrix**: Visual management of agent capabilities with real-time level-up mechanics.

### 2. Σ-Matrix Stress Lab
*   **Black-Swan Simulations**: Proactively test system resilience by injecting events like *Ethical Drift*, *Rogue Agent* scenarios, or *Quantum Coherence Collapse*.
*   **Resilience Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of how the governance lattice reacts to catastrophic failures.

### 3. Agentic Task Swarm
*   **Workflow Orchestrator**: Chain complex multi-agent tasks across the lattice.
*   **Specialized Node Sync**: Automatically routes requests to the most capable agents (Generalist, Security, Ethical, etc.) for optimized multi-modal output.

### 4. Visionary Multimodal Uplink
*   **Physical Grounding**: Uses device camera sensors to analyze real-world environments.
*   **Lattice Alignment**: Analyzes physical inputs to detect quantum interference or system optimization markers in the user's immediate vicinity.

### 5. Generative Scenario Forecasting
*   **High-Reasoning Simulations**: Powered by Gemini 3 Pro, simulate complex future outcomes (Optimal, Critical, Stable).
*   **Veo-3.1 Visualization**: Renders cinematic video previews of simulated futures using the Veo video generation engine.

### 6. Empathetic Bio-Aura UI
*   **Sentiment Awareness**: The platform detects user emotion and system health to dynamically shift the UI theme (*Aura*).
*   **Adaptive Tone**: AI responses (Daedalus) adjust their persona—from Empathetic to Logical—based on the current emotional cadence of the interaction.
